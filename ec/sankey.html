  <h3>Sankey Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    The challenge for this week is to create a Sankey diagram of Titanic shipwreck victims and survivors. I've constructed a directed acyclic graph of counts, located <a href="../datasets/titanic-sankey.json">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset contains nodes for age quartiles, cabin class, sex, and mortality. Your final Sankey diagram should using the following order: Age -> Mortality -> Cabin Class -> Sex
  </p>
  <p>
    To construct your visualization, you will need to import the <a>d3-sankey library</a>. One easy way to do this is by adding this tag to your HTML header: 
  &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/d3-sankey@0&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  <p>
    This is an implementation challenge, not a design one. While it would be good practice to make an appealing and effective design, we will accept submissions that successfully construct a discernable chart. Here is one example that successfully displays a chart but does not necessarily practice the best design principles:<br/>
     <img src="snky.png" width=500/>
  <p>
    Submit your answer to CMS in the form of a .zip file containing your own HTML and a copy of the dataset. Submissions will be graded for completeness rather than quality, and the "best" ones will be highlighted in class.
  </p>
  <p>
    You must turn in your final version before 11:59PM on Friday, April 17 in order to receive credit.
